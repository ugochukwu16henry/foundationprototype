    <section class="container story">
        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>Founded in 2010, the Community Empowerment Foundation began with a simple mission: to create sustainable
            change in underserved communities. What started as a small initiative with just three volunteers has grown
            into an organization that impacts thousands of lives annually.</p>
        <p>Our journey began when our founder, Maria Rodriguez, witnessed firsthand the challenges faced by communities
            lacking access to basic education, healthcare, and economic opportunities. Determined to make a difference,
            she gathered a team of like-minded individuals who shared her vision of a world where every person has the
            opportunity to thrive.</p>
